### Work
Importing functionality works fine, user can type keyword then the keyword and a number will import into the keyword.txt. 
### Need to solve
check the existing keyword in the keyword.txt, if it's there, update database.txt if user want. If it's not there, import new data and update the number of data for that keyword
